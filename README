The files jacorb.jar and idl.jar in this directory are a patched version of 
JacORB 2.3.0. The patched libraries identify themselves as 

        JacORB V 2.3.0 (JBoss patch 5), www.jacorb.org

Instructions for generating these files are included below.

Kudos to the JacORB team, for this great open-source ORB.

Special thanks to:

        Gerald Brose, for creating JacORB

        Andre Spiegel, for his work on OBV in JacORB

 *** How to generate the jacorb.jar and idl.jar files in this directory ***

(1) Obtain a JacORB 2.3.0 source tree, with the following command:

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@www.jacorb.org/cvsroot/jacorb checkout -r RELEASE_2_3_0 JacORB

(2) Apply the following patches from this directory:

cd JacORB

Patch1:         jacorb-2.3.0-version.patch
# The size of a chunk should not include any bytes of padding that might have
# been added after the chunk for alignment purposes. This patch allows JacORB 
# to interoperate with the ORB in Sun's JDK 1.5 with chunking of custom RMI
# valuetypes enabled (jacorb.interop.chunk_custom_rmi_valuetypes=on), as it 
# should be per the CORBA spec. 
Patch2:         jacorb-2.3.0-chunk_size.patch
# In handle_chunking: change to distinguish a null value tag from
# a chunk size tag (the latter must be positive).
# In read_untyped_value and readChunkSizeTag: changes for correctness (to 
# ensure that chunk_end_pos is set to -1 if we are not within a chunk) and 
# for clarity.
Patch3:         jacorb-2.3.0-null_value_tag.patch
# Fix for bug #782 in JacORB's bugzilla system:
# The creation of an SSLServerSocket fails when JacORB 2.3.0 uses the JSSE
# included in Sun's JDK 1.4 and later releases. The problem is in the wrapper
# class JSSEUtil, which causes an IllegalAccessException to be thrown.
Patch4:         jacorb-2.3.0-JSSE.patch
# Fix for bug #783 in JacORB's bugzilla system:
# Server throws CORBA.INTERNAL (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException) when a client
# uses an IOR with a component tagged with TAG_CSI_SEC_MECH_LIST. When the 
# current implementation of the method 
# org.jacorb.orb.iiop.IIOPProfile.getTLSPortFromCSIComponent finds an IOR
# component that is tagged with TAG_CSI_SEC_MECH_LIST and has a non-empty list
# of security mechanisms, it assumes that the first mechanism listed has a 
# transport component tagged with TAG_TLS_SEC_TRANS. It tries to access the 
# data of the presumed TLS_SEC_TRANS component, without first checking the 
# component's tag. If this tag is TAG_NULL_TAG rather than TAG_TLS_SEC_TRANS, 
# then an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs.
Patch5:         jacorb-2.3.0-IIOP.patch
# Fix for NPE on shutdown
Patch6:         jacorb-2.3.0-IIOP_Shutdown.patch
# This patch resets the port of the primary address to zero when an
# IORInterceptor adds a TAG_CSI_SEC_MECH_LIST component with transport
# protection requirements (SSL), as it should be per the CSI v2 specification.
Patch7:         jacorb-2.3.0-primaddress_port.patch
# The SSL profile check is unnecessary and incorrect, as it should also check
# for the presence of the TAG_TLS_SEC_TRANS tag in the IIOPProfile.
# By not doing so, it causes JacORB not to open SSL connections when the
# server-side IORs contain only the TAG_TLS_SEC_TRANS tag. We can just
# eliminate this verification since the remaining method body already performs
# the necessary checks correctly.
Patch8:         jacorb-2.3.0-ssl_verification.patch


(3) Build with the following command:

ant -Ddebug=off all doc

(If you want a debug version use just 'ant all doc')
